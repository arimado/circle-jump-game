# circle jump game

This is a html5 game dev tutorial from [*netuts*](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/build-your-first-game-with-html5/)

#notes - 16 july

Not a very good learning tutorial for a beginner.

However i learnt the existence and somewhat of a method implementation of Box2D. 

A object-oriented flow is simple enough ([*diagram here*](http://www.mindmeister.com/310342137#))

I'll have to play around with it to get the most of the tutorial.

This tutorial is good for an introduction to Box2D.
